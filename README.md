# Wut's this?

Probably an archive for some of my stuff of some sorts. This is to make sure nothing very important gets lost.

# How does this work?

apindex. Every time I push something to master it then runs apindex in a Github workflow, and deploys it to the gh-pages branch.

# Why not just store it in your computer or flash drive?

It can still get lost that way. Generally all this repo is is a safe spot for all of my shit that I upload.
